   -Quantitative- numbers- Discrete( countable) & Continous(measurable)

   Datasphere- describes all the data created.
   Terabytes-X-rays in a large hospital.

   Data to insights
   Data-Knowledge-Wisdom-Insight

   # Role of Data
   * Helped us undestand the world in completely new ways
   * *Improved our ability to make better-informed decisions.
   * Support our efforts to sovle problems.

     # Data-driven decision making
     -Example- Reviews
     Data needs to be organized, analyzed, make decision, identify problems & feed other systems.

     Data Owner: describes the rights a person, team or organization has over one or more data set

     # Data Architecture
     -Ensures data is available to those who need it &approved to use it.
     -Reducing the complexity of accesing & utilizing data.
     -Creating & enforcing data protection
     -Adopting & agreeing to data standards
     -Optimizin the flow & effective use of data.

     # Lifecycle data
     -Creation- data creation manually/automatically( internally /externally)
     -Storage-Data must be stored in DB ,could be in local Hard Drive, server or cloud
     -Usage- Should be cleaned for errors, transform to another format
     -Archival-move data to a long term storage & can be retrieved when needed
     -Destruction-Making data inaccessible & unreadable

     # Impact of Big data
     IBM - used to automate data without errors.

     Big Data
     -Structured/Unstructured data that is massive & complex in scale

     Characterize big data
     -Volume
     -Variety
     -Velocity
     -Variability
     Veracity-Quality

       # CHAPTER 3 !!! Driving value through Data
     *Organization operations include:
     -payroll, Order management &marketing
     -These operation use data to :
     *Make decisions
     *Enable systems to run

Governing Data
-Some level of control exists to support a related policy.
# Essential features for the success of governing data
-People
-Policy
-Metrics

# CHAPTER 4!!! Transforming through data

DATA GOVERNANCE: also helps to eliminate unnecessary data silos.
Essintial reasons for availability of data:

-Better informed decision-making.
-Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
-Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
-Improved data analytics and reporting.
-Higher performing systems.
-More efficient operations.
-Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.

# Data catalogs -inventory of an organisation's data assets.
Search engine-provides the location of data

Benefits of Data Catalogs:
* Finding data-users can identify & locate data
* Understanding data-answers a variety of data questions
* Making data more useful-creates visibility,describes values & provides access to information.

It also delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. Contains data about data CALLED Metadata.

Components of data catalog(list of data assets)
-Data Visualization
-Data Assessment
-Data collaboration
-Data Governance
-Administrator
-Automation & machine learning

3 TYPES OF METADATA
*Technical
*Business
*Operational

# EXAMPLES OF METADATA
Associated systems.
File names.
File locations.
Data owners.
Data descriptions.
Dates created.
Dates last modified.
List of database tables and views.
Data stewards.
Size of data sets.
Quality score.
Comments.

# With a data catalog, an organization can:

-Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
-Reduce data duplication.
-Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
-Understand data quality.
-Manage compliance.
-Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.

Acquiring & applying insight from data means : Dimensions
* Context- understanding the environment
* Need- determine how insights will help to accomplish the objective
* Vision-having ideas about how insights will help.
* Outcome-specify how insights will be adopted & success will be measured

  # Dimension can be used to answer questions such as:
  -Whats is required
  -Does that data exist?
  -Is it current?
  -Is it easily availaable ?
  -What format is the data in?
  -What kind of data analysis is required?
  -How will the data be presented?

  Data Analysis: identifies dataset, examine it, report on the findings.
  Data Analytics:
  -Collecting
  -Cleaning
  -organizing
  -Storing
  -Administering
  -Analyzing
